      description: |
        The controls catalog ensures the usability of CNCF deliverables by GRC professionals and Auditors of Cloud Native systems. 
        The primary goal is to support quickly identifying the controls status of cloud-native environments, and 
        methods to share the output of those assessments in machine readable formats (OSCAL, JSON, etc.).
        These outputs should also map to existing frameworks and regulations (CSA, NIST, FedRAMP, SOX, GDPR, etc.), 
        and provide guidance to properly validate and verify administrative and technical controls.

        text: |
          SCM platforms allow the configuration and restriction of source code 
          operations on individual branches. Protection rules can be used to enforce 
          the usage of pull requests with specified precondition and approval rules, 
          ensuring that a human code review process is followed or an automated status 
          checking of a branch occurs. Additionally, protected branches can be used to 
          disallow dangerous use of force pushes, preventing the overwrite of commit 
          histories and potential obfuscation of code changes.
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's branch protection rules to require at least **two**
          non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
          primary branch.
