      title: Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog
      version: "1.0"
      url: https://github.com/cloud-native-security-controls/controls-catalog/blob/main/controls/controls_catalog.csv
      description: |
        The controls catalog ensures the usability of CNCF deliverables by GRC professionals and Auditors of Cloud Native systems. 
        The primary goal is to support quickly identifying the controls status of cloud-native environments, and 
        methods to share the output of those assessments in machine readable formats (OSCAL, JSON, etc.).
        These outputs should also map to existing frameworks and regulations (CSA, NIST, FedRAMP, SOX, GDPR, etc.), 
        and provide guidance to properly validate and verify administrative and technical controls.

        recommendation: |
          Configure GitHub branch protection rules to enforce proper code review practices:
          - Require at least **one** reviewer with equal or greater expertise (adjusted for projects with two maintainers)
          - Enable code owner review to ensure reviewers have appropriate expertise
          - Enable stale review dismissal to maintain review quality
          - Require review thread resolution for thorough review process
          - Ensure pull request rules exist for the main branch
