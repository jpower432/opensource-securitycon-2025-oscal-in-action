# OSCAL in Action: Real World Examples of Automating Policy & Compliance

## Abstract OpenSource SecurityCon November 2025

Imagine you're trying to read a book while someone's simultaneously ripping out pages, rewriting chapters, and gluing in new sections. That's what gathering compliance evidence in a cloud native environment is like. The rapid evolution in how systems are deployed, secured, and governed leaves organizations struggling to connect abstract cybersecurity regulations with concrete, enforceable policies.
This talk provides a practical blueprint for bridging that gap. We'll show how CNCF projects - like the newly released OSCAL Compass Compliance-to-Policy (C2P) v2 and Open Policy Agent (OPA) - work together to transform regulatory requirements (expressed in Open Security Controls Assessment Language) into actionable policy-as-code artifacts that generate verifiable, audit-ready evidence. Focusing on the end-to-end approach, we'll dive into the tools and practices involved, providing real-world examples of automating compliance in cloud-native environments.
