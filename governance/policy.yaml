      description: |
        The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental,
        sound, and secure software development practices based on established
        secure software development practice documents from organizations such as
        BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models
        explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in
        the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation.
        Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the
        number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact
        of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
        address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also,
        because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software
        development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster
        their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

        The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security criteria that projects 
        should meet to demonstrate a strong security posture. The controls are organized by maturity level 
        and category. In the detailed subsections you will find the control, rationale, and details notes.

        text: |
          When a commit is made to the primary branch, the project's version
          control system MUST require at least **two** non-author approval of the
          changes before merging.
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's version control system to require at least **two**
          non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
          primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be
          reviewed and approved by at least **two** other collaborators before it can
          be merged.
